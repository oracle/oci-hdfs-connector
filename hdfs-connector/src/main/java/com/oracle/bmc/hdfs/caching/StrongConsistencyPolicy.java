/**
 * This consistency policy evicts cache entries that have an etag that differs from the current etag.
 *
 * Note that this incurs the overhead of making a HeadObject request before every GetObject request. After that
 * request, any cached items with differing etags will be evicted, forcing the object to be read again from Object
 * Storage.
 *
 * The synchronization point is the point at which the HeadObject request is processed by Object Storage.
 * The etag becomes part of the cache key, meaning two requests for the same object can proceed in parallel if the
 * etag from the HeadObject request differed.
 *
 * This means that if an object is requested, and the download is ongoing, then the object is changed, and
 * a second request is made, both requests will continue and deliver differing results. It is irrelevant when those
 * requests finish; the synchronization point is when they were begun (or more accurately, when the HeadObject
 * request was processed).
