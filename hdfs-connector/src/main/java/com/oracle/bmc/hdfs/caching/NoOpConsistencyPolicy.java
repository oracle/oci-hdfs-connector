/**
 * This consistency policy does not do any evictions.
 *
 * Using this consistencyPolicy, the cache has no knowledge of etag and if-match/if-none-match` built in and will happily
 * serve contradictory results.
 *
 * Example:
 * 1. Let's say you do a GetObject with if-match=foo, and it succeeds. It will cache that response.
 * 2. Then you do a GetObject with if-match=bar, and because that exact request is not in the cache,
 *    it will go to the service. Let's say that succeeds too. It will cache that response.
 * 3. Now you could make GetObject requests both for if-match=foo and if-match=bar`, and it will serve
 *    successfully from the cache.
 *
 * The fact that if-match=bar succeeded does not evict the request with if-match=foo. Nor do any successful
 * requests with different etag response headers evict them.
 *
 * This policy does not perform any consistency-preserving operations. The cache will retain any object, for as long
 * as the cache eviction policy will allow. If an object changes in Object Storage, that will go unnoticed until the
 * cache evicts a cache entry for time- or size reasons.
 *
 * The cache may even cache and return contradictory responses, e.g. two responses that specify contradictory
 * "if-match" arguments, essentially implying that the object exists with two different etags, and therefore
 * contents, simultaneously.
 *
 * This policy should really only be used if the data in Object Storage does not change, and therefore, consistency
 * does not have to be preserved.
