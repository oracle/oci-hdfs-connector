## 3.3.1.0.3.6 - 2022-06-07
### Fixed
- Fixed oci-hdfs jar file to not contain class files from `hadoop-common` and `hadoop-hdfs`

## 3.3.1.0.3.5 - 2022-05-31
### Added
- Added support for specifying custom read stream class. This feature can be enabled by setting the property `fs.oci.io.read.custom.stream` to the name of the custom read stream class.
- Added support for specifying custom write stream class. his feature can be enabled by setting the property `fs.oci.io.write.custom.stream` to the name of the custom write stream class.

## 3.3.1.0.3.3 - 2022-04-26
### Fixed
- Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in read-ahead mode [#69](https://github.com/oracle/oci-hdfs-connector/issues/69)

### Added
- Added support for Resource Principals Authentication v2.2

### Changed
- Added relocation for shaded packages `org.objectweb`

## 3.3.1.0.3.2 - 2022-01-25
### Added
- Added support for caching `BmcFilesystem` instances. This feature can be enabled by setting `fs.oci.caching.filesystem.enabled` to `true. If enabled, the properties `fs.oci.caching.filesystem.maxsize.count` and `fs.oci.caching.filesystem.initialcapacity.count` control the size of the cache, while either `fs.oci.caching.filesystem.expireafteraccess.seconds` or `fs.oci.caching.filesystem.expireafterwrite.seconds` control the expiration. If a `BmcFilesystem` instance exists in the cache with the same URI and configuration, the instance will be re-used, leading to performance improvements at the cost of the cache's memory footprint.

## 3.3.1.0.3.1 - 2022-01-06
### Changed
- Updated `log4j` dependencies to version `2.17.1` to address CVE-2021-44832

- Updated `log4j` dependencies to version `2.15.0` to address CVE-2021-44228
- Removed dependencies `log4j-core`, `log4j-slf4j-impl`, `log4j-1.2-api` by default . To include these dependencies, run `mvn` 
with option `-Duse-slf4j-log4j`

## 3.3.1.0.0.1 - 2021-10-28
### Changed
- Updated to OCI Java SDK version 2.7.1

### Fixed
- Updated Jetty version to `9.4.44` from `11.0.6` (minimum requirement of Java 11) to add back support for older versions of Java

## 3.3.1.0.0.0 - 2021-08-31
### Added
- Added support for disabling auto-close of object streams that are obtained through `getObject` operation. This can be disabled by setting `fs.oci.object.autoclose.inputstream` to `false`. If disabled, the streams obtained through `getObject` that are completely read will not be closed automatically. If not specified, this option will be enabled by default.

### Changed
- Updated to Hadoop version 3.3.1

## 3.3.0.7.0.1 - 2021-06-29
### Added
- Added support for multi-part upload streaming using a finite-sized in-memory buffer. This mode can be enabled by setting `fs.oci.io.write.multipart.inmemory` to `true`. If enabled, `fs.oci.client.multipart.numthreads` should be set to the number of parallel threads (greater than 1). `fs.oci.io.write.multipart.inmemory` cannot be enabled at the same time as `fs.oci.io.write.inmemory`. `fs.oci.io.write.multipart.overwrite` controls whether objects are allowed to be overwritten (default is `false`). `fs.oci.io.write.multipart.inmemory.tasktimeout.seconds` sets the number of seconds before giving up for upload tasks that cannot start because the maximum number of parallel threads has been reached (default is `900`, meaning 15 minutes).

## 3.3.0.7.0.0 - 2021-06-22
### Added
- Added support for changing to Jersey default `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` for sending HTTP requests using the `fs.oci.client.jersey.default.connector.enabled` configuration key
- Added support for changing the maximum number of connections in the connection pool when using the Apache Connector for sending HTTP requests using the `fs.oci.client.apache.max.connection.pool.size` configuration key
- Added support for changing the connection closing strategy when using the Apache Connector for sending HTTP requests using the `fs.oci.client.apache.connection.closing.strategy` configuration key
- Added support for parallel `renameDirectory` operation and support for changing the number of threads when performing the `renameDirectory` operation using the `fs.oci.rename.operation.numthreads` configuration key
- Added support for Resource Principals Authentication
- Added support for more ways to build object storage endpoint by using the `fs.oci.client.regionCodeOrId` configuration key and by using instance metadata

### Changed
- Updated to OCI Java SDK version 2.0.0
- Usage of Jersey's `ApacheConnectorProvider` by default for sending HTTP requests
- Performance issues due to upgrade to Jersey's `ApacheConnectorProvider` by default. For changing back to Jersey default `HttpUrlConnectorProvider` and other performance enhancements, look into `BmcProperties`

### Fixed
- `com.oracle.bmc.hdfs.store.BmcReadAheadFSInputStream read()` now correctly identifies EOF

## 3.3.0.5 - 2021-05-04
- Added payload caching using the `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.enabled` key.
  - This is an on-disk cache that stores payloads in the directory indicated by`fs.oci.caching.object.payload.directory`.
  - The cache size can be configured using `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.maxweight.bytes` or `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.maxsize.count` (mutually exclusive).
  - The property `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.initialcapacity.count` controls the initial cache size.
  - The cache's eviction policy is controlled using `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.expireafteraccess.seconds` or `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.expireafterwrite.seconds` (mutually exclusive).
  - A consistency policy can be set using `fs.oci.caching.object.payload.consistencypolicy.class`. The default is `com.oracle.bmc.hdfs.caching.StrongConsistencyPolicy`, which ensures that the cache is consistent with objects in Object Storage (if an object is changed in Object Storage after it was cached, the cached item will be evicted, and the object will be loaded from Object Storage). If you know your data is immutable, you can set this property to `com.oracle.bmc.hdfs.caching.NoOpConsistencyPolicy`, which does not check for consistency, therefore reducing the number of requests by a factor of two.
  - It is important to (a) close streams read from HDFS, (b) read the streams to their end, or (c) allow those streams to be garbage-collected by the Java runtime. Otherwise, cached items may remain on disk even after they have been evicted.

## 3.3.0.4 - 2021-04-27
- Updated transitive Jetty dependencies to 9.4.40.v20210413 to address CVE-2021-28165.

## 3.3.0.3 - 2021-04-02
- Updated to OCI Java SDK version 1.35.0

## 3.3.0.0 - 2021-03-16
### Added
- Added metadata caching using the `fs.oci.caching.object.metadata.enabled` and `fs.oci.caching.object.metadata.spec` configuration keys. Note that there is no check for consistency, and if your data in Object Storage changes, the cache may return outdated data. Therefore, it is most appropriate when your data is read-only and does not change. Use caution when applying these settings.
- Added read-ahead and parquet caching. The read-ahead feature is configured using `fs.oci.io.read.ahead` and `fs.oci.io.read.ahead.blocksize`. Parquet caching, which requires `fs.oci.io.read.ahead=true`, is controlled using `fs.oci.caching.object.parquet.enabled` and `fs.oci.caching.object.parquet.spec`. Note that there is no check for consistency, and if your data in Object Storage changes, the cache may return outdated data. Therefore, it is most appropriate when your data is read-only and does not change. Use caution when applying these settings.
- Added Jersey client logging, configured using `fs.oci.client.jersey.logging.enabled`, `fs.oci.client.jersey.logging.level`, and `fs.oci.client.jersey.logging.verbosity`.
